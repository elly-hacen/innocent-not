# Encryptr                    

This repository provides a simple and efficient way to encrypt and decrypt messages, files, and entire directories using the Fernet symmetric encryption from the cryptography library. The system includes a user-friendly menu-driven interface to perform various encryption and decryption operations.

## Features

- **Message Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt plain text messages.
- **File Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt individual files of any type.
- **Directory Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt all files within a specified directory.
- **Key Management**: Automatically generates and manages encryption keys.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elly-hacen/encryptr.git
   ```                                        
2. Change the directory
   ```bash
    cd innocent
   ```                     
  
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to start the menu-driven interface:
```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to choose and perform encryption or decryption operations:

- **Encrypt a Message**: Encrypt a plain text message and display the encrypted text.
- **Encrypt a File**: Encrypt a specified file and overwrite it with the encrypted content.
- **Encrypt a Directory**: Encrypt all files in a specified directory.
- **Decrypt a Message**: Decrypt an encrypted message and display the plain text.
- **Decrypt a File**: Decrypt a specified encrypted file and overwrite it with the decrypted content.
- **Decrypt a Directory**: Decrypt all files in a specified directory.
